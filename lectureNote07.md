# Forms in html 
  - forms take in data from the user and do something with it.
  -  the default behavior of the form submission  is wierd - there is a prevent default() default of forms is to erase all of the content the user entered.
  -  all form data comes in as string data
  -  we can recieve the data by listening for the form to be submitted for a button click.
  
## Browser Events
  - pretty much any time a user interacts with the poage it is an event
  -  you can activate a lister in javascript to react if a specific event occurs
  - add a listner to a webopage
  -  user fills the fomr and we wait for them to submit.
  - identify the in JS getElementById('form')
  - attach a listner to your element
  - we want to listen for a submit and what that happens we will do something, 
  - handle the event when it occurs
