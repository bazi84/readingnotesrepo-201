# CSS Grid
Grid is a layout system that allows you to set up a series of row and column lines and place item with, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
The grid properties are supported in all modern browsers.

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">6</div>
  <div class="grid-item">7</div>
  <div class="grid-item">8</div>
  <div class="grid-item">9</div>
</div>

An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.
