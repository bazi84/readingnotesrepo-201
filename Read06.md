### Object Literals

    One of the easiest way to create an object is the literal notion way.

      - The object is the curly braces and their contents. 
      - The object is stored in variable 
      - use colon to seperate each key from its value
      - use comma to seperate each property and method.
      - when setting properties treat each values like you would do for variables: string live in a quote and array live in square brackets.
      - you access the property or methods of an object using dot notation or using square brackets.

      Example:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp
      public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
