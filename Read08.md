# CSS Layout
    CSS Display Properties are four types
      - Block 
      - Inline
      - Inline-Block
      - None
    Block elements take up the whole width of the webpage as a result blocking out any other element from sitting next to it in the left or on the right.
      ### Common Block Elements
        - Paragraphs
        - Headers
        - Divisions
        - Lists and list items
        - Forms
      
      The default layout order is determined by your code

      Children sit on parents, by default in html all children will sit on top of parent
    
    ## Positioning 
        Content is everything. its the first thing that determines how large the height and width will be this is despite any css.

        The four types of positioning in CSS
          - Static
          - Relative
          - Absolute
          - Fixed
        All html elements are static by default which means go along with html rules and keep with the html flow.

        Relative position allows to postion relative if it were static. when you move an element that has a relative postion, it doesn't effect the position of anything else on screen.
    ## The FOUR COORDINATES:
          - TOP 
          - BOTTOM
          - LEFT
          - RIGHT
          Absolute position you can move the element from its original position.
